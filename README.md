# Fren-chef
Learn French culture through VR cooking

Hi, my name is Mathis Eyssautier and this is the code to my Master 1 VR project for year 2022.

We were hoping to help people discover our French culture throughout a serie of quests, leading to the creation of a typical French meal : Boeuf Bourguignon. 
Let us guide you through this journey to becoming a true Fren'chef !

-- INTERNSHIP --

I am in my 5th and last year of VR studies, and actually looking for an 6 months internship in Unity / C# starting in april 2023. 
I am very interested in working among the infinite field Unity and C# have to offer, and hopefully in your company ! 
You can join me anytime by email at mathis.eyssautier@gmail.com and I would be pleased to send you my CV.

Looking forward to working by your side,

Mathis Eyssautier
